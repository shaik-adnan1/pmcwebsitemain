: ABOUT
“Committee is not about the King, it’s about the kingdom.”

When one thinks of a mentor, we are often drawn to images of a wiser, older adult passing on wisdom and skills to a younger protégé— a college professor encouraging a student, a craftsman passing on his skills to his apprentice. And while most mentoring relationships involve a hierarchical structure and an imbalance of experience, knowledge, or skill, there is a type of mentoring that approaches these relationships from a slightly different perspective: peer mentoring.

: OBJECTIVES
Participating in peer mentoring programs will help first-year mentees:
Understand and utilize the campus resources that VITAP has to offer.
Create and make progress toward goals that matter to them.
Enhance their feeling of connection and belonging at VITAP.

=> Who are peer mentors?
: WHO ARE PEER MENTORS?
Peer Mentors guide mentees while they pursue academics or career opportunities. They are role models who provide emotional support and validation, assist their mentees in navigating the campus resources, and help their peers become more engaged in the VIT-AP community. The mentors are not necessarily always a professor or alumni.

: PEER MENTORING PROGRAM
This program pairs students with more experienced peers to help navigate their transition as students of VIT-AP university.

So what essentially is peer mentoring? Peer mentoring is a term used to describe a student-student relationship in which one student mentors the other through college. Students can also help their juniors and seniors likewise.

Peer mentoring distinguishes itself from other methods of mentoring as it maintains a strong emphasis on one-on-one correspondence and support building.

Peer mentors provide information, support, and a friendly atmosphere to newcomers in the campus.

First-year students are not the only ones who get benefits from this program, undergraduates in their second and third year can also get benefited.

College students can enhance the sought-after soft skills that employers want by mentoring younger peers. Furthermore, peer mentors get the opportunity to support the progress of the new undergraduate class at their alma mater.

According to research, peer mentoring can assist students in adjusting to college life, strengthening their sense of belonging on campus, and increasing their level of interest and involvement in their studies.

=> Benefits
: BENEFITS OF PEER MENTORING
Research suggests that peer mentoring can help students navigate college, feel greater connection to campus and become more engaged and involved in their learning. That’s why we’re dedicated in developing robust and supportive mentoring programs: these are critical factors that affect student success, especially in a student’s first year of college.

In fact, participation in peer mentoring programs is often associated in the research with improved freshman retention rates.
